# MICRO - Human Bodily Micromotion in Music Perception and Interaction

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and MATLAB scripts for processing and analysing data collected as part of the [MICRO](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/projects/micro/) project at the University of Oslo.

## Content

The data consists of a series of experiments named "Championship of Standstill" where groups of participants were asked to stand as still as possible
while being exposed to auditory stimuli (music and rhythms). There is also one data set (HPvSP) where participants were exposed to music in two conditions: through headphones and through speakers.

More information on each edition of the Championship of Standstill and the HeadphonesvSpeakers data set can be found in their respective description text files.
