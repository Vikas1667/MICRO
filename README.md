Championships of Standstill - MICRO

Jupyter notebooks and MATLAB scripts for processing and analysing data collected as part of the MICRO project at the University of Oslo.
The data consists of a series of experiments named "Championship of Standstill" where groups of participants are asked to stand as still as possible
while being exposed to auditory stimuli (music, rhythms) as well as a data set where participants were exposed to music in two conditions: through headphones and through speakers.

More information on each edition of the Championship of Standstill and the HeadphonesvSpeakers data set can be found in their respective description text file.
